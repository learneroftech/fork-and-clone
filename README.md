> 🛠️ This repository is a **fork** originally created by **learneroftech**.  
> It was **updated and maintained** by **Vswengineer** as part of a hands-on Git collaboration exercise from [Git & GitHub Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/?srsltid=AfmBOorSbtMmRGIMKinjpnURZL23qxiE1qZVNmFrgRiso1iqKsTmNS1Y&couponCode=KEEPLEARNING).  
> This is a **practice project** to demonstrate my understanding of the fork-and-clone Git workflow—an essential skill for team-based and open-source software development.  
> 
> ⚙️ Even this README explanation itself was created and updated through the full workflow: making commits locally, pushing changes to my fork (Vswengineer), opening pull requests to the original repository (learneroftech), and having those pull requests reviewed and merged. This hands-on process reinforced how collaboration works in real projects.

## 🧾 Project Context

This whimsical “ice cream flavor” repository was originally created by **learneroftech**. As **Vswengineer**, I forked the repository to my own GitHub account and followed a full contribution workflow used widely in collaborative coding:

- ✅ **Forked** the original repository to my account  
- ✅ **Cloned** my fork locally to make changes  
- ✅ **Set up a second remote (`upstream`)** to track changes from the original repository  
- ✅ **Pulled updates** from the original to keep my fork in sync  
- ✅ **Made edits** and committed changes locally  
- ✅ **Pushed** those changes to my fork  
- ✅ **Opened a pull request** to contribute back to the original project  
- ✅ **Had my pull request accepted and merged**

This process mirrors how developers contribute to major open-source projects.

## 🔍 What I Practiced and Learned

As the **contributor**, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Using GitHub’s fork-and-clone collaboration model  
- Managing multiple remotes (`origin` for my fork and `upstream` for the original)  
- Synchronizing forked repositories with upstream changes  
- Making and documenting commits responsibly  
- Submitting and managing pull requests  
- Understanding workflows used by teams and open-source communities

All changes were tracked and documented through real GitHub commits and pull requests, showcasing real-world version control and collaboration skills.
