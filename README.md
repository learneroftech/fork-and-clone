> 🛠️ This repository was created and updated by **Vswengineer** as part of a hands-on Git collaboration exercise from [Git & GitHub Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/?srsltid=AfmBOorSbtMmRGIMKinjpnURZL23qxiE1qZVNmFrgRiso1iqKsTmNS1Y&couponCode=KEEPLEARNING). It is a **practice project** to demonstrate my understanding of the fork-and-clone Git workflow, an essential skill for team-based and open-source software development.

## 🧾 Project Context

This whimsical “ice cream flavor” repository was originally created by **learneroftech**. As **Vswengineer**, I followed a full contribution workflow used widely in collaborative coding:

- ✅ **Forked** the original repository into my own GitHub account  
- ✅ **Cloned** the fork locally to make changes  
- ✅ **Set up a second remote (`upstream`)** to track changes from the original repository  
- ✅ **Pulled updates** from the original to stay in sync  
- ✅ **Made edits** and committed changes locally  
- ✅ **Pushed** those changes to my fork  
- ✅ **Opened a pull request** to contribute back to the original project  
- ✅ **Had my pull request accepted and merged**

This is the same process developers use to contribute to open-source projects like React, TensorFlow, or Linux.

## 🔍 What I Practiced and Learned

As the **contributor**, I practiced:

- Using GitHub’s fork-and-clone model
- Managing multiple remotes (`origin` and `upstream`)
- Synchronizing forked repositories with upstream changes
- Creating and pushing commits responsibly
- Submitting meaningful pull requests
- Understanding how teams manage outside contributions

All changes were tracked and documented through real GitHub commits and pull requests, reinforcing real-world skills in version control and collaboration.
